👋 Welcome, I'm Dilshan Kumara!
Full Stack Developer | Mobile & Web Enthusiast | Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

Hi there! I’m passionate about crafting **seamless web and mobile experiences** with clean code and stunning UI/UX. Whether it’s building robust backends, cross-platform apps, or responsive websites, I love turning ideas into reality.


Introduction

Innovior is designed to help you build a strong foundation in the core technologies that power their projects. Here’s what you can expect to learn:

1. **Core Technologies for Innovior’s Projects**:
   - You’ll gain hands-on experience with tools and technologies used in **custom Software Development**, **Robotics and IoT integration**, and **Machine Learning model implementation**.
   - The focus will likely include programming languages, frameworks, or platforms relevant to these domains (e.g., Python, C++, ROS for robotics, TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML, or IoT protocols like MQTT).

2. **Understanding the ‘Why’ Behind Tools**:
   - You’ll learn the purpose and rationale for using specific tools in Innovior’s workflows, helping you make informed decisions when applying them to real-world problems.

3. **Practical, Hands-On Skills**:
   - The guide emphasizes active learning through tasks like:
     - **Creating accounts** for relevant platforms or tools (e.g., cloud services, GitHub, or IoT dashboards).
     - **Writing and debugging code** to build small projects or prototypes.
     - **Experimenting** by breaking and fixing code to understand how systems work and fail.

4. **Problem-Solving and Debugging**:
   - By intentionally breaking and fixing things, you’ll develop critical troubleshooting skills essential for software development, robotics, IoT, and ML projects.

5. **Mentor-Supported Learning**:
   - You’ll learn how to leverage your mentor’s expertise by asking targeted questions, ensuring you overcome challenges and deepen your understanding.

6. **Foundational Knowledge for Contribution**:
   - The guide prepares you to contribute to Innovior’s innovative solutions by equipping you with the skills needed to collaborate on complex, interdisciplinary projects.

While the exact tools or technologies aren’t specified in the intro, expect to explore industry-standard ones tailored to Innovior’s focus areas. The emphasis on “doing” over just reading ensures you’ll gain practical, actionable skills to hit the ground running.👋 Welcome, I'm Dilshan Kumara!
